The data set our team decided to explore was a YouTube data set from Kaggle. This data set provided
information about the trending videos from 2017 to 2018. The quantitative measurements we had access
to were: views, likes, dislikes, number of comments, trending date, and release date. The original compiler
of the data additionally categorized the videos into 32 categories. We were able to analyze the different
variables associated with each video to help see what type of video will most likely become a trending video.
The plots and data analysis in this R-Notebook are aimed at answering the following four questions:
- What channels have the highest number of likes? 
- Which categories get the most comments? 
- What does the distribution of the comments and the views look like? 
- Which category spends the most days on trending on average?
